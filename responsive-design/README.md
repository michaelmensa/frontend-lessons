# Responsive Design

## Learning Objectives:
- **Mobile-first design:** Understand starting the design process with the mobile layout as the primary focus, ensuring it works well on small screens and progressively enhancing it for larger screens.
- **Media-queries:** Mastery of using CSS media queries to conditionally apply styles based on factors such as screen size, resolution, and device orientation.
- **Sizes for responsive web design:** Familiarity with viewport units like vw and vh, as well as pixel-based and percentage-based measurements, to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
- **How to make a website responsive:** Acquire the skills to develop websites that dynamically adjust their layout, content, and functionality to provide an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Differences between responsive and adaptive design:** Understanding the distinctions between responsive design, which fluidly adjusts to different screen sizes, and adaptive design, which uses predefined layouts for specific screen sizes.
- **CSS units for flexible elements:** Proficiency in using flexible CSS units such as percentages, viewport units, and relative units like em and rem to create elements that scale proportionally with their containers or the viewport.
