# React Intro

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to understand the following concepts related to React:

1. **Creating a Basic JavaScript Application using React**: You will learn how to set up a basic React application and understand the fundamental concepts of React components, state, and props.

2. **Using create-react-app Package**: You will learn how to use the `create-react-app` package, a tool that provides a pre-configured environment for quickly starting a new React project.

3. **Understanding JSX**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe the UI elements. You will learn how to write JSX code and understand its benefits in simplifying React component development.

4. **Debugging with React Developer Tools**: React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug React component hierarchies in the browser's developer tools. You will learn how to utilize this tool for debugging React applications effectively.

5. **Testing with Enzyme's Shadow Rendering**: Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React developed by Airbnb. You will learn about Enzyme's Shadow Rendering feature, which allows you to render React components in isolation for testing purposes.

6. **Integrating React with Webpack & Babel**: Webpack and Babel are popular tools used for bundling and transpiling JavaScript code, respectively. You will learn how to integrate React with Webpack and Babel to optimize the development workflow and ensure compatibility with older browsers.
